# UNIX-AND-C-Programming
unix and c programming 
This is a simple arrow based game where you can interact with the arrow using WASD key binds on the terminal.
The game is created using C language and all the files are included in the zip directory
The game was created solely to be run on Unix systems only.
To run the game,unzip the files in a directory and open the terminal
After that type in Make in the terminal to compile all the files
After compiling the files
Type in "./Maze 0 2"
You can choose any value between 0-2 in the terminal to run the game,the difference will be in the map(grid) size of the game.
Now the game does have some flaws which i want you to look and fix.
All the files have appropiate comments as well.
Enjoy the code and the game!
